# Excel Challenge

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this assignment, I will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

I used pivot tables, conditional formatting, and pivot charts to organize and analyze/visualize the dataset.
